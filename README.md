# Car Go Space?

## No, car no do that, car no fly

Working on training an agent to drive a car in 2d space hopefully going from very simple to progressively more complex scenarios.

Trying to use a camera simulation set up. It's a 2d space so just calculating how much of the raycast is road vs not.

Also including distance to target, if I can figure out how to make it more complex I'll add some route planning.
